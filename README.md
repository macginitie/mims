# mims
(from https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/munging:
"...the process of changing data into another format \[...\] so that it can be used or processed...")

I could've called it "Image Processing" but then my acronymic would've honored a RISC chip maker instead of the great Forrest M. Mims III -- or maybe I just like the word "munging"...
